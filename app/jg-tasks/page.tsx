            <p className="font-ibmPlex">
              The application is designed to optimize task management and
              accounting systems. Users can enter tasks with detailed
              information, track their status, and filter and sort tasks as
              needed. Advanced filters are available and can be loaded
              dynamically. <br /> The web application was built using the
              Next.js stack, with React, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase for the
              database and authentication system. I used TanStack Table for
              builidng table, Recharts for data visualization, React Virtuoso
              for virtualization and Tanstack querry for infinite scrolling
              feature

          <div className="space-y-6">
            <p className="font-ibmPlex">
              Initially, the application faced performance issues when handling
              over 10,000 tasks. To address this, I implemented table
              virtualization using React Virtuoso. This approach allows tasks to
              render dynamically based on the visible window, which improves
              performance. While the virtualization improved usage performance,
              the initial loading time remained lengthy. To tackle this, I
              integrated TanStack Query to load additional rows as users scroll
              to the end of the table. This setup fetches 50 new rows at a time
              and continues as needed. Integrating this with filters, sorting,
              and search functionality was challenging, but leveraging
              PostgreSQLâ€™s database functions helped streamline the process.

              The application includes role-based access control. Some users
              have read-only access, while others can edit, and a select group
              has access to a dashboard with visualized data. This dashboard
              includes KPIs for comparing company performance with previous
              months, which, though initially non-essential, has become a
              valuable addition.

              The entire development process took about four months, during
              which I extensively tested and learned. I had to start over twice
              before completing the project. Despite these setbacks, the
              application has been in use by the company for over six months.
              Throughout the project, I balanced development with my full-time
              studies, which added to the complexity of the process.

              continues to be optimized and updated. I used Webpack Bundle
